<h1>The Best Movies According to James</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. Interstellar really blew me away. The mix of science and emotion was just incredible—watching Cooper leave his daughter to save humanity hit me hard. The visuals, especially around the black hole, were jaw-dropping, and Hans Zimmer’s music gave me chills.
What stuck with me most was how the film showed love as something powerful, even across time and space. It made me think about family, sacrifice, and how small we are in the universe. I couldn’t stop thinking about it after the credits rolled.</p>
<h3>Batman The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>The Dark Knight was intense and unforgettable. Heath Ledger’s Joker completely stole the show—he was terrifying, unpredictable, and somehow fascinating to watch. The way the movie explored chaos, morality, and justice made it feel deeper than just a superhero film.
What I loved most was how Batman had to make impossible choices and live with the consequences. It showed that being a hero isn’t always about winning—it’s about doing what’s right, even when no one sees it. The ending hit me hard. It wasn’t just action-packed; it was powerful.</p>
<h3>Captain America The Winter Soldier</h3>
<p>Captain America: The Winter Soldier surprised me in the best way. It felt more like a spy thriller than a typical superhero movie, with twists that kept me hooked. Seeing Cap question everything he believed in, especially about S.H.I.E.L.D., made his character even more interesting.
The emotional weight of facing his best friend, Bucky, who had become the Winter Soldier, really hit me. It wasn’t just about fighting—it was about loyalty, identity, and doing what’s right in a world full of grey areas. Definitely one of my favorites in the MCU.</p>
